# FracturePoint

Website for the band FracturePoint.

## Features

- Modern black background design
- Matte pewter/gold navigation buttons
- Two main sections:
  - **Upcoming Shows** (landing page)
  - **Photos & Video**

## Setup

Simply open `index.html` in a web browser to view the site locally.

**Note:** The logo image should be saved as `logo.png` in the project root directory. The logo will appear as a very faded background covering the entire page. If your logo file has a different name or format (jpg, webp, etc.), update the `background-image` URL in `styles.css` (line 30).

## Future Development

- Connect to a domain URL when available
- Add actual show dates and venues
- Add photos and video content
- Additional pages/sections as needed
